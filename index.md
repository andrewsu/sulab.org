Welcome to the home page for the lab of Andrew Su. Our group works in the field of bioinformatics, both developing and applying computational tools for biomedical discovery. We have a particular emphasis on open source, open data, and open science. We are located at [Scripps Research](https://scripps.edu) in sunny La Jolla, California.
